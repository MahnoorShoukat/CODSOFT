Task 2: Movie Rating Prediction With Python

Statement:
Build a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on
features like genre, director, and actors. You can use regression
techniques to tackle this problem.
The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model
that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or
critics.
Movie Rating Prediction project enables you to explore data
analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine
learning modeling techniques. It provides insights into the factors
that influence movie ratings and allows you to build a model that
can estimate the ratings of movies accurately.

Solution: 
For this Movie Rating Prediction task, I performed data 
preprocessing , handling missing values, one-hot encoded 
genre data, label encoded the director and actors. 
The data is then divided into training and testing sets. 
Using a Linear Regression model, I have trained the dataset.
