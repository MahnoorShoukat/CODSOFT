Task 4: Sales Prediction Using Python

Statement:
Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that
customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such as
advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and
advertising platform selection.
In businesses that offer products or services, the role of a Data
Scientist is crucial for predicting future sales. They utilize machine
learning techniques in Python to analyze and interpret data, allowing
them to make informed decisions regarding advertising costs. By
leveraging these predictions, businesses can optimize their
advertising strategies and maximize sales potential. Let's embark on
the journey of sales prediction using machine learning in Python.

Solution: 
In the Sales Prediction project, I have used a dataset to create a model 
for forecasting product sales based on various factors such as advertising 
expenditures on TV, radio, and newspaper. After importing the necessary 
libraries and exploring the data, I visualized relationships between features 
using pair plots and analyzed correlations with a heatmap. Then scaled the data, 
split it into training and testing sets, and trained a Linear Regression model.
