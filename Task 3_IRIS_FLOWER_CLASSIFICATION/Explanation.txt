Task 3: Iris Flower Classification

Statement:
The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor,
and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their
measurements. Now, imagine that you have the measurements
of Iris flowers categorized by their respective species. Your
objective is to train a machine learning model that can learn from
these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into
their respective species.

Use the Iris dataset to develop a model that can classify iris
flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal
measurements. This dataset is widely used for introductory
classification tasks.

Solution: 
In this Iris Flower Classification task, I haveÂ used the 
Iris dataset to create a model for categorizing iris flowers 
into several species based on the measurements of its sepal and 
petals. Have performed Data pre-processing, Data Visulatisation, 
Data encoding, partitioning the data into training and testing sets 
and then trained a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier. 
The classification report and confusion matrix heatmap show that 
the model performed excellently in correctly classifying iris flowers 
into their respective species, with a remarkable accuracy of 100%.
