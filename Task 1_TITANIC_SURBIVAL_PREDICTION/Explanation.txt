Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

Statement:
Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a
passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner
project with readily available data.
The dataset typically used for this project contains information
about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket
class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

Solution: 
For this Titanic Survival Prediction task, I performed data 
preprocessing , handling missing values, encoding categorical 
variables, and developing a new feature called "Family-Size". 
The data is visualized to obtain insights, and then it is 
divided into test and training sets. Using training data, 
a logistic regression model was trained and get an accuracy of 100%. 
A classification report  and the visual representation of the 
confusion matrix's is also displayed.
